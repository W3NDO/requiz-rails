The remote groups in N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligands have a significant influence on metal-catalyzed reactions. We examine how remote bulkiness, electronic groups, and expanded-ring NHCs (ER-NHCs) influence alkene reactivity and regioselectivity toward hydrocupration using density functional theory calculations. The impact of remote steric bulkiness on the Cu–H insertion rate is analyzed, revealing a strong correlation between the steric substituent constant and rate ratio, where a bulky group increases the rate due to reduced steric effects in the transition state (TS). The steric properties of the examined catalysts (with a remote group R2 = CPh3, CHPh2, CH2Ph, CH3, and H) and their corresponding TSs are found to be modulated greatly by the remote steric substitution group and the ring size of the NHC ligand. Enhanced bulkiness enhances the nucleophilic Cu–H moiety. The remote electronic groups have a smaller impact on insertion barrier compared to that of steric hindrance. Furthermore, ER-NHC exploration indicates that NHCs with over five-membered rings have a significantly negative influence on the reaction rate. Finally, with a highly bulky group (R2 = CPh3), anti-Markovnikov insertion preference is attributed to high interaction energy and improved steric properties. Overall, our findings here provide valuable insights for the development of a more effective catalyst in metal-catalyzed reactions.
