In general, making evaluations requires a lot of time, especially in thinking about the questions and answers. Therefore, research on automatic question generation is carried out in the hope that it can be used as a tool to generate question and answer sentences, so as to save time in thinking about questions and answers. This research focuses on automatically generating short answer questions in the reading comprehension section using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN). The questions generated use article sources from news with reliable grammar. To maintain the quality of the questions produced, machine learning methods are also used, namely by conducting training on existing questions. The stages of this research in outline are simple sentence extraction, problem classification, generating question sentences, and finally comparing candidate questions with training data to determine eligibility. The results of the experiment carried out were for the Grammatical Correctness parameter to produce a percentage of fifty nine point five two percent, for the Answer Existence parameter it yielded ninety two point two four percent, while for the Difficulty Index parameter it produced a percentage of thirty four point nine two percent. So that the resulting average is sixty three point two three percent. So, this software deserves to be used as an alternative to automatically create reading comprehension questions
