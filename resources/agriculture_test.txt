Recent estimates indicate that the demand for pork and poultry products in East Africa will increase 4-fold by 2030 (1). In Kenya, the increase in pork consumption is projected to increase 125 and 268% in 2030 and 2050, respectively (2). Much of this increase stems from changing consumption patterns attributed to urbanization, increasing incomes and human population growth. In this regard, the region mirrors change elsewhere in sub-Saharan Africa and more widely across similar low-income settings. Pork meat provides an opportunity to cater for the projected increasing demand for meat. There is an ongoing shift toward monogastric food systems, as pigs like other monogastric animals have shorter production cycles, require smaller land areas and have better concentrate feed conversion rates than ruminants (3). However, this diversification and increased demand has led to will lead to unintended consequences leading to food safety risks (4, 5). The risks range from increased environmental contamination to public health effects, because of an expected higher incidence of zoonotic pathogens and other infectious diseases. Therefore, with increased demand and expanding urbanization, food systems will need to adapt to meet consumer's demands, but at the same time to ensure safe quality products and avoid environmental problems. Understanding how the pork food system operates in a rapidly growing developing city is crucial to facilitate its adaptation and formulate recommendations on system improvements.

Nairobi is one of the rapidly growing cities in Africa with a population of 4.4 million people (6) and an estimated population of 305,489 pigs (7), equating to pig biomass of 0.11 kg per person (8). In Kenya the current per capita consumption of pork is 0.4 kg, behind bovine meat at 12.2 kg, mutton/goat at 2.2 kg, and poultry at 0.6 kg (8). Pork is one of the sectors with higher potential to grow and to provide increased economic opportunities for farmers (9, 10). Currently, intensive pig farming and free range scavenging systems are the most prevalent farming systems in the country (11, 12). The majority of peri-urban farmers in Nairobi confine their pigs (13, 14), while in rural areas, most pig keepers let their pigs scavenge for feed (15–18). This system is however common in urban Nairobi, in particular dumping sites (19), and is characterized by minimal or no health care, supplementary feeding, poor housing and high level of inbreeding (13, 15). In terms of pig abattoirs, few exist in Kenya and much of the slaughter takes place informally in farms and unlicensed slaughter points. The licensed abattoirs have clear market distinctions and functionality. There is one large pork processing firm in the country which accounts for over 80% of the national supply of processed products. Three other abattoirs (Ndumbuini, Lyntano, and Kabati), situated in Nairobi or its peri-urban area, represent the rest of the pork abattoirs serving the city. The remaining pork chains run through unorganized slaughter slabs and local backyard slaughtering (11).

There is a paucity of data on how the Nairobi pork system is organized and operated, with respect to market nodes, governance, challenges, and food safety issues. Such information is crucial to understand the sector, identify growth opportunities, and support national food safety policies and disease control programmes. For this, value chain analysis (VCA) studies are a useful approach to understanding the dynamics of the production system, flow of products and disease transmission impact on different actors' incentive structures and behaviors (20, 21), while facilitating understanding governance, upgrading opportunities, and structural deficiencies (14, 22). Governance represents the other key pillar of this analysis, and aims to understand the coordination and power distribution in the chains (22, 23). Assessing the governance of the system can then provide insight on how diseases are effectively managed in the chains by different stakeholders, especially in case of shocks, such as disease outbreaks. It can also help identify those stakeholders with the highest influence and capacity to dictate and enforce food safety norms or private standards. We have previously undertaken similar studies focused on other commodities (14, 24–26).

The aim of this study was, (i) to map the pork system supplying Nairobi through abattoirs, markets and urban, peri-urban pig keepers and retailers; and (b) to assess the challenges and governance of these chains and their potential influence on disease and food safety risk management.
The following varieties are available in Kenya

    Chandler Strawberry Variety

Vigorous and high yielding, the Chandler Strawberry variety produces very desirable strawberries. Chandler Strawberries are very large, and firm and produce within 60 to 75 days. The shape of the chandler strawberry ranges from long and wedge-like shape to being conical in shape and large in size. They have brilliant red colour and glossy look, with an exceptional flavour.  

Chandler strawberries are good for export or fresh market.  They are very good for freezing. They are not the best for processing

    Douglas Strawberry

The Douglas strawberry is a vigorous plant with clear forage with a semi-erect habit. It produces elongated berries that are conical in shape and orange-red in colour. The berries have firm red flesh, with a pink centre. They have good taste and resistance to transport damages.  The Douglas strawberry gives high yields.  

    Aiko Strawberry

The Aiko strawberry produces uniform large conical berries, with a pointed end. They have firm pale red firm flesh that is slightly sweet. They are resistant to transport damages and have high yields. 

    Pajaro Strawberry

The Pajaro strawberry is a short day variety, that gives berries that are symmetrical in shape. It is late maturing, with low production, making it not popular.  

    Fern Strawberry

The Fern strawberry is a day-neutral variety that is high yielding with firm skin and sweet berry. It is good for fresh markets and processing. 

    Cambridge Favourite Strawberry

The Cambridge strawberries produce many runners, small-sized sweet berries.  It is resistant to most diseases.
