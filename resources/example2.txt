Self-organizing maps (SOMs) are a data visualization technique invented by Professor Teuvo Kohonen which reduce the dimensions of data through the use of self-organizing neural networks. The problem that data visualization attempts to solve  is that humans simply cannot visualize high dimensional data as is so techniques are created to help us understand this high dimensional data. The way  SOM’s go about reducing dimensions is by producing a map of usually 1 or 2 dimensions which plot the similarities of the data by grouping similar data items together. So SOM’s accomplish two things, they reduce dimensions and display similarities. As you will see, like colors are grouped together such as the greens are all in the upper left hand corner and the purples are all grouped around the lower right and right hand side. The idea of the self-organizing maps is to project the n-dimensional data (here it would be colors and would be 3 dimensions) into something that can be better understood visually (in this case it would be a 2 dimensional image map).
